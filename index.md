The house is air conditioned, heated by gas, and is designed for superior ventilation. The home has never accommodated smokers, nor in-room pets. An exceptionally friendly and quiet golden retriever is on site. Beautiful back yard deck and seating, and extensive gardens in season are yours to enjoy. The five foot interactive kaleidoscope is a favourite with guests, and often neighbours stop by as well to view this fun gizmo. Parking available at no additional charge, as well as secure storage for bikes and sports equipment.

The space also functions well as a retreat or getaway venue for small groups. Generous access to a piano is possible.

All linens and towels are provided.
