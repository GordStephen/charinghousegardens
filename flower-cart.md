Mixed flower bouquets, including dahlias, are available from the self serve Flower Cart several days a week. Flowers are fresh picked each morning, collected into attractive, generous bouquets, and offered at a discount price. All bouquets are $10.

The Flower Cart is prepared by noon. It is parked in the driveway until sold out, or sunset. It is intended that friends and neighbours will take advantage of this opportunity to have fresh flowers in their homes at minimal cost. To pick up a bouquet earlier in the day, or to ensure a quantity of bouquets for a special occasion, or to check availability, please call (Phone 613-226-8112).

Charing House Gardens is located at <a href="/contact/">32 Charing Road, Nepean, Canada, K2G 0Z5</a> in the community of Craig Henry.

Call, or check the calendar to learn which days the Flower Cart will be available.
